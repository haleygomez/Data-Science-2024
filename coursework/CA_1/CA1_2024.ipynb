    "A group researching cancer have previously found that the genetic marker D3 is a useful indication that a person will develop the more aggressive form of melanoma skin cancer, in that D3 is present in 65% of the aggressive cases. However the test is expensive.  A rival group claim that the marker M23 is more sensitive than D3, and works out considerably cheaper to test for. The rival research team manage to get DNA samples from 7 patients with the aggressive form of the disease, all of whom test positive for the genetic marker M23. Based on these results, is M23 a better marker for the disease than D3? \n",
