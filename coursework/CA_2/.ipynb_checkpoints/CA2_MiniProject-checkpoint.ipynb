    "Gravitational waves are disturbances in the curvature of spacetime, generated by accelerated masses, that propagate as waves outward from their source at the speed of light.  They are predicted in General Relativity and other theories of gravity and since 2017, they have now been observed!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will analyse some mock gravitational wave data from two unknown astrophysical objects merging together and coelescing. We will use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to compare a scaled model that predicts how the wave changes depending on the total mass of the merging objects and their distance from us to the observed waveform.  This will allow us to determine the nature of the orbiting objects that merged to form the gravitational wave using MCMC, whether for instance they could be originating from merging white dwarfs, neutron stars or black holes.\n",

    "Now that we have some mock data and a reference waveform, we need to do one more fix.  Currently the data waveforms and our reference waveforms have different sampling on the $x$ axis - ie they have different values of $x$ (time). The reference waveforms have approx 20,000+ time steps, yet our data has less than hundreds of data points in the same time range!
