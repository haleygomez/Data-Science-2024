    "A company releases a new ski wax that it claims (naturally) is superior to its rivals, and greatly reduces the friction between skis and snow. A skiing magazine decides to test the claim by performing an experiment. They take 10 pairs of skis, and treat one ski from each pair -- the left one -- with the new wax, and the other (the right) ski with the wax from a competing brand. Each pair of skis are then released from the top of a ramp in turn, and they record which of the two skis reach the bottom of the ramp first.    The team find that the new skis win 8 of the 10 races.  Is their claim correct?"
