    "Please ensure you have watched the Chapter 8 video(s). This notebook introduces some of the theory behind your Data Analysis \"project\" in CA 2. In this project you will analyse some mock gravitational wave data from two unknown astrophysical objects merging together and coelescing. We will use a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) to compare a scaled model that predicts how the wave changes depending on the total mass of the merging objects and their distance from us to the observed waveform.  This will allow us to determine the nature of the orbiting objects that merged to form the gravitational wave, whether for instance they could be originating from merging white dwarfs (remnants of low mass stars), neutron stars (remnants of intermediate to high mass stars) or black holes (the remnants of very massive stars)."

LIGO found that the best model waveform to explain the discovery observations suggests the binary system had a total mass of $\\sim65$ solar masses. They used Bayesian inference to determine that this waveform most likely resulted from two black holes with masses of $35^{+5}_{-3} \\,M_{\\odot}$ and $33^{+3}_{-4} \\,M_{\\odot}$ at a distance of $440^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc from Earth ([Abbott et al. 2016](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102)).
