    "To enable us to remote work and learn the necessary tools for Data Analysis (and scientific research in general), we will be using two modern computing concepts: **Interactive coding** (with Jupyter notebooks) and **cloud computing (with Google Colab)**.  Google Colab is a free place to run code without needing huge machines.\n",

It will make online working easier for us in this course, but these are also very useful skills to have on your CV.  It may surprise you to know that Jupyter notebooks are used in all sorts of fields including in intrepreting data of covid-19 infection spread, in the Nobel prize winning gravitational wave physics research, Google, Microsoft, finance institutions and many more.\n",

Again this is widely used in industry and is the language of choice for NASA, Google, CERN, Instagram, Spotify, YouTube, Industrial Light & Magic, Pixar, JPMorgan Chase and Citadel.  Why is it so popular?  It's easy to learn, clear to read, and simple to write."
