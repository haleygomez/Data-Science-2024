Useful things including reading in datafiles from experiments or telescopes, plotting data, plotting error bars, calculating some useful statistics, and perhaps probabilities, and fit models (lines/curves) to the data.  Python is really useful because we can *import* packages that already have built in tools to make publication quality plots, or estimate the mean or median and so on. These packages include  Numerical Python `numpy` and Scientific Python `SciPy` as well as plotting packages such as `Matplotlib`.   \n",

You do not need to be an experienced programmer, since there are some easy hints and tips that will allow you to do things in a simple way.

There are a wealth of [online examples](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) for making plots, some publication level quality, and some more simple. In this course, we don't need to spend time on making publication level quality plots, but rather to try and make scientific data appear clear - ie labelled axes, large enough fontsize, legends.\n",

You can add more data via using plot(x2,y2) to add more lines/datapoints on the same curve.  We can logscale our plots or our data points if we wish using `plt.loglog(x,y)` or `plt.semilogy(x,y)`. We can show scatter plots (data points) using scatter(x,y).  Histograms can be drawn using hist(x,bins) and so on."
